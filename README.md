Pokedex
=======

The idea for this app came from a friend of mine who said, "Hey! ... We should catch all of the Pokemon this summer."  We both thought this was a great idea and ran with it.  We decided that we would catch them cumulatively, but then arose the issue of how we would keep track of which ones were caught!

Thus, my Pokedex app was born.  

I used the Parse framework to create a shared database of Pokemon and modify that database between phones.  I used a table view to represent the data, along with the checkmark to show if they have been caught or not.
